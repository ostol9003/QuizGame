# QuizGame
Project I made for the Java Advanced course in my second year of study.  
It is a simple quiz game about Harry Potter movies.  
20 questions, for each question 4 answers, one correct.

Project has a server that collects players' scores into a .csv file.  

Questions are saved in a JSON file.
